# Group Currencies

In addition to individual CRC currencies, Circles has introduced the concept of Group Avatars and Currencies. The idea behind Group currencies is to social-economic value amongst groups, without the geographical bounds of where groups are generated or created. Group avatar tokens can't be minted based on time, rather depends on personal collateral.&#x20;

If you want to become a part of group, you would require to be invited to the group itself by the group admin. Invitation to groups would be that you are simply trusting a human avatar. Now, in order to mint the group tokens, as a group member (human avatar in the group) you would require to trust the group address so that you can start accepting the tokens. When you are trusting a human, you are also trusting their personal tokens. You can currently mint group tokens based on the quantity of total personal tokens (CRC).

The current mint policy allows you to mint group tokens based on your total personal CRC tokens quantity that you hold as a human. In other words, your personal tokens would be swapped for your group tokens.
