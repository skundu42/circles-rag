# The Circles Stack

Our developer documentation portal provides comprehensive guides, SDK references, contract addresses, and code examples to help you integrate Circles into your applications and build upon our ecosystem.

## Circles SDK

If you want to develop a server or client application that utilizes Circles, and allow you to utilize trust connection and personal/group currencies, then Circles SDK would be your entry point. Based on your need, you can pick to develop any avatar post initialization of SDK.

* [Circles SDK package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk)
* [Circles SDK source code](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-sdk)

The SDK allows you to seamlessly use all features of **Circles V1** and **Circles V2**. These include:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sign Up</strong></td><td>Sign up as a human, organization, or group effortlessly using Circles v1 and Circles v2 features.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Trust, Mint &#x26; Transfer</strong></td><td>Trust, mint, and transfer personal and group Circles seamlessly.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Query Data</strong></td><td>Query balances, trust relations, and transaction histories with ease.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Subscribe &#x26; Query Events</strong></td><td>Subscribe to and query events within the Circles network.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Circles Infrastructure

Circles relies on some infrastructure components to make it work.&#x20;

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pathfinder</strong></td><td><p>Finds liquid paths between two accounts in the trust network. These paths are used as input for the contract's transfer methods.<br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/circlesUBI/pathfinder2">Learn more about Pathfinder</a></p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles Nethermind Plug-in</strong></td><td><p>Provides access to the Gnosis Chain and indexes Circles events for a seamless experience.<br></p><p><a href="https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-nethermind-plugin">Learn more about Circles Nethermind Plug-in</a></p></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Contracts

In case the Circles SDK is not something you can directly use in your application, you can also utilize the deployed contracts.

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Circles V1 contract source code</strong></td><td><p>Review the codebase for Circles Contracts V1, including all core features and specifications related to Hub Contract and minting.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://github.com/circlesubi/circles-contracts/">Circles V1 Contract code</a></p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles V2 Reference docs</strong></td><td><p>Explore the latest updates and functionalities of Circles v2.0 Contracts with detailed documentation.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://aboutcircles.github.io/circles-contracts-v2/">Circles V2 Reference docs</a></p></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Circles V2 contract source code</strong></td><td>Review the codebase for Circles contracts V2 which follows ERC1155 standard, and manages personal, group and organisation avatars.</td></tr></tbody></table>
